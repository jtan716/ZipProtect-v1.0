# ZipProtect
Zip Protect is a simple utility app for macos that helps users zip-encrypt their folders.


## Intro 
In macOS, there is no GUI friendly way to zip files with password encryption. However, macOS has a native ZIP package utility called ZIP(1L). The only way to zip-encrypt folders or files is to go to open a new terminal and run a shell script. This is fustrating for those who do not want to constantly interact with the terminal.


My program seeks to remidiate this issue; the end goals of ZipProtect is to allow users to zip-encrpyt folders with a GUI-friendly app. This app will now be limitied to just zipping folders rather than a file or multiple files. 


## Requirements 
This app requires Apple's XCode to develop; the app is developed on MacOS environment. 


## Dependencies 
This app only depends on native XCode libraries; no external packages or libraries are used in this project.
